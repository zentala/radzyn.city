# Radzyń City Portal - Vision Document

## Project Overview
The Radzyń City Portal aims to be a comprehensive digital hub for both residents and visitors of Radzyń Podlaski city and county. This platform will integrate essential city information, services, and interactive features to enhance civic engagement and accessibility of local resources.

## Technical Architecture

### Application Structure
The application is organized into four distinct workspaces:
- **Core**: Shared utilities, types, and common functionality
- **Backend**: API services, database interactions, and server-side logic
- **Frontend**: React-based user interface with static pre-rendering capabilities
- **Mobile**: Cross-platform mobile application (using Electron or similar framework)

### Technology Stack
- **Package Management**: pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript for type safety across the entire codebase
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js 14 for server and client components
- **UI Components**: Material UI v6 with baroque-inspired custom theme
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
- **Typography**: Google Fonts for accessible, performant typography
