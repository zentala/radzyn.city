# Test Fixes Summary

## 1. Navigation Timeout Issues
- **Problem**: Tests were timing out during navigation with error `TimeoutError: page.goto: Timeout 10000ms exceeded`
- **Fix**: 
  - Increased navigation timeout from 10000ms to 30000ms in `playwright.config.ts`
  - Added test setup script to ensure development server is running before tests

## 2. Duplicate Navigation Role
- **Problem**: Two elements had the navigation role causing selector conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed `role="navigation"` from the mobile menu div in `Navigation.tsx`

## 3. Navigation Testing Issues
- **Problem**: Navigation tests were failing with URL verification
- **Fix**: 
  - Replaced `page.waitForNavigation()` with `page.waitForURL('**/path')` 
  - Updated all navigation tests to use more modern approach

## 4. Form Submission Testing
- **Problem**: Form submission success message tests were failing
- **Fix**:
  - Added a small delay (100ms) to the form submission success state update
  - This makes tests more reliable by ensuring the state update has time to propagate

## 5. Test Performance
- **Problem**: Tests were running slowly using all browser configurations
- **Fix**:
  - Updated Playwright config to only use Chromium during development
  - All browsers still run in CI environments

## 6. Server Startup
- **Problem**: Tests were failing because the server wasn't running
- **Fix**:
  - Added test setup script that checks if server is running
  - Automatically starts server if not running
  - Modified package.json scripts to run the setup before tests

## Additional Improvements
- Improved test stability by using more reliable waiting patterns
- Improved selectors in tests (e.g., using `page.locator('nav')` instead of `page.getByRole('navigation')`)
- Added error handling to server startup script
